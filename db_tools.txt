		db.user.find()
		db.podcast.find()
		
		db.books.find({ "Year": { $gt: 2000 } })
		db.books.find({ $and: [{ "Available": true }, { "Year": { $gt: 2000 } }] })

//////

//////

db.users.aggregate([
  {
    $project: {
      "First Name": 1,
      "Last Name": 1,
      "Number of Possessed Items": { $size: "$Possessed" }
    }
  }
])

/the one under does not work

db.user.aggregate([
  {
    $match: {
      $expr: { $gt: [{ $size: "$Possessed" }, 0] }
    }
  },
  {
    $project: {
      "Title": 1,
      "Author": 1,
      "Possessed by Users": "$Possessed"
    }
  }
])
